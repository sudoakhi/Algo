# Algorithms Implementation in C#

Welcome to the Algorithms Implementation in C# repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to major algorithmic problems using the C# programming language.

## Overview

This repository serves as a resource for individuals interested in algorithmic problem-solving using C#. Here, you will find well-commented and organized solutions to a variety of problems ranging from fundamental algorithms to more advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different categories based on the type of problems. Looks for the namespaces starting with Data Structure name

- Arrays Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming [DP]
- Graphs Algorithms
- Strings Algorithms
- Stack Algorithms
- Linked List Algorithms [LL]
- Binary Tree Algorithms [BT]
- Binary Search Tree Algorithms [BST]
- Greedy Algorithms
- And more...

Each category contains multiple problems and solutions in C#.

## How to use?

Look for Runner class in each problem directory. Provide inputs and validate exptected outut by invoking the Run() method from Program.cs

## Contributing
